A huge solar flare, the largest since <DATE>2017</DATE>, has been spotted erupting from the <LOC>Sun</LOC>’s surface.Solar flares are made up of electromagnetic radiation that travel from the <LOC>Sun</LOC> at the speed of light and can reach <LOC>Earth</LOC> in <TIME>about eight minutes</TIME>.They can disrupt some radio communications and satellites but most of us are unlikely to see those effects.There is also a chance that northern latitudes could see <WORK_OF_ART>the Northern Lights</WORK_OF_ART> <DATE>this weekend</DATE> as <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> geomagnetic storms are predicted to hit <LOC>Earth</LOC>.Solar flares do not cause <WORK_OF_ART>the Northern Lights</WORK_OF_ART>.They are caused by a phenomenon called coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that erupt from an active sun spot.Combined with flares, they can create solar storms that interact with <LOC>Earth</LOC>'s magnetic field or magnetosphere.The CMEs spew out plasma and magnetic field, and up to <QUANTITY>billions of tons</QUANTITY> of material, that can hit <LOC>Earth</LOC>.As our magnetosphere repels the storm, it creates the aurora.“There is the potential for a coronal mass ejection to arrive at <LOC>Earth</LOC> <TIME>late on</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE> or <TIME>early on Saturday</TIME>, which could lead to visible aurora for <GPE>Scotland</GPE>, <GPE>Northern Ireland</GPE> and parts of northern <GPE>England</GPE>,” said <ORG>Met Office</ORG> Space Weather Manager <PERSON>Krista Hammond</PERSON>.A <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> CME is likely to hit <LOC>Earth</LOC> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, associated with the solar flare which is rated <CARDINAL>X9</CARDINAL>.That means “enhanced auroral visibility is possible further south across central <GPE>England</GPE> and similar latitudes, though cloud and rain could hamper viewing potential for some,” says <PERSON>Krista Hammond</PERSON>.In the <GPE>US</GPE>, aurora might be seen in the northern states, and from the mid-west to <GPE>Oregon</GPE>, according to <ORG>NOAA</ORG>’s <ORG>Space Weather Prediction Centre</ORG>.The <CARDINAL>X9</CARDINAL> solar flare emitted is the largest categorised by <ORG>Nasa</ORG>.The smallest is B, followed by C, M, and X.The scale ranks from <CARDINAL>1</CARDINAL> to <CARDINAL>9</CARDINAL>, so X<CARDINAL>9</CARDINAL> is the most powerful in <ORG>Nasa</ORG>'s ranking.The <LOC>Sun</LOC> is approaching something called “solar maximum” which is when it is most active in an <DATE>11-year</DATE> cycle.As the <LOC>Sun</LOC> continues in this active phase, <LOC>Earth</LOC> is more likely to be hit by strong geomagnetic storms, meaning there is higher chance of seeing <LOC>the Aurora Borealis</LOC> for <DATE>the next few months</DATE>.But scientists only know if solar maximum has happened <DATE>six months</DATE> after the event,  because they use <DATE>six months</DATE> of data analysing the intensity and frequency of sun spots.Current predictions suggest we could reach solar maximum at <DATE>the end of 2024</DATE> or <DATE>early 2025</DATE>.<ORG>BBC</ORG> weather presenter <PERSON>Simon King</PERSON> says the <GPE>UK</GPE> weather does not look good for people hoping to spot the aurora <DATE>this weekend</DATE>.“It would just be the far north-east of <GPE>Scotland</GPE> getting the odd break in the cloud for a short time,\" he says.“If activity turns out to be a bit stronger, the best of the clear skies on <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> will be more towards central and south <GPE>England</GPE>.He says clouds may hamper viewings on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> despite the evening starting with a lot of clear skies.Forecasters say the lights will likely be confined to the north of the <GPE>UK</GPE>, with those in <GPE>Scotland</GPE> best placed to see them.The fantastic night-sky light display explained.Aurora chasers across <GPE>Cumbria</GPE> and the north east of <GPE>England</GPE> capture images of spectacular skies.The lights - also known as aurora borealis - make an appearance in <GPE>Northamptonshire</GPE>.Weather watcher photos from across <GPE>Northern Ireland</GPE> show the dazzling lights.
