"<GPE>WASHINGTON</GPE>, <DATE>October 11</DATE>.<NORP>Ukrainian</NORP> President <PERSON>Vladimir Zelensky</PERSON> is now more open to negotiating with <GPE>Russia</GPE> as <GPE>Ukraine</GPE>’s position has weakened, <ORG>The Washington Post</ORG> (<ORG>WaPo</ORG>) reported.According to the newspaper, <NORP>Western</NORP> diplomats \"have sensed\" that the <NORP>Ukrainian</NORP> leader \"has become more open to beginning negotiations with <GPE>Russia</GPE>, even as <GPE>Moscow</GPE>’s forces occupy <PERCENT>more than 20%</PERCENT> of <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> and are unlikely to cede any territory they currently control.\"Thus, <PERSON>Zelensky</PERSON> has said that \"<GPE>Russia</GPE> will be invited to the next peace summit that <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> plans to organize.\"<GPE>Kiev</GPE> has signaled the importance of ending the conflict as <GPE>Russia</GPE> has gained ground on the battlefield, <ORG>The Washington Post</ORG> wrote.<GPE>Kiev</GPE> has repeatedly rejected peace and mediation initiatives from <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> countries, saying it will only promote the so-called <PERSON>Zelensky</PERSON> formula.In <DATE>late September</DATE>, before leaving for a trip to <GPE>the United States</GPE>, <PERSON>Zelensky</PERSON> said he had some kind of \"plan\" to increase pressure on <GPE>Russia</GPE>, which he would first present to <GPE>US</GPE> leader <PERSON>Joe Biden</PERSON>.Later, <NORP>Ukrainian</NORP> <ORG>Presidential Office</ORG> Head <PERSON>Andrey Yermak</PERSON> clarified that the \"plan\" will be presented to the country’s citizens without some \"sensitive\" details only after it has been shown to <GPE>Kiev</GPE>’s <NORP>Western</NORP> partners.On <DATE>June 14</DATE>, <NORP>Russian</NORP> President <PERSON>Vladimir Putin</PERSON> at a meeting with <ORG>the Foreign Ministry</ORG> set out the country’s conditions for settling the situation in <GPE>Ukraine</GPE>.Among them are the withdrawal of the <NORP>Ukrainian</NORP> armed forces from <GPE>Donbass</GPE> and <GPE>Novorossiya</GPE> and <GPE>Kiev</GPE>’s refusal to join <ORG>NATO</ORG>.In addition, <GPE>Russia</GPE> wants all <NORP>Western</NORP> sanctions against it lifted and demands that <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> commit to a non-aligned and nuclear-free status.<GPE>Kiev</GPE> rejected the <NORP>Russian</NORP> peace plan.Following the launch of <GPE>Ukraine</GPE>’s incursion into the borderline region of <GPE>Kursk</GPE> on <DATE>August 6</DATE>, the <NORP>Russian</NORP> leader said it would make no sense to negotiate with a government attacking civilians."
"<GPE>MOSCOW</GPE>, <DATE>October 11</DATE>.<GPE>Moscow</GPE> says <GPE>Bern</GPE> is not neutral enough to mediate the <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> conflict; <NORP><GPE>Russia</GPE>n</NORP> Foreign Minister <PERSON>Sergey Lavrov</PERSON> comes to <GPE>Laos</GPE> for the <LOC>Asia</LOC> summit; and <GPE>Russia</GPE>, <GPE>China</GPE> have a cooperative vision for <LOC>Eurasia</LOC>.These stories topped <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s newspaper headlines in <GPE>Russia</GPE>.<GPE>Switzerland</GPE> is not a neutral party in the <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> crisis, so <GPE>Moscow</GPE> believes it cannot serve as a proper mediator in peace talks, <ORG>the Russian Embassy</ORG> in <GPE>Switzerland</GPE> told <ORG>Izvestia</ORG>.\"<GPE>Switzerland</GPE> is <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> <NORP>pro-Ukrainian</NORP>, joining all of the <ORG>EU</ORG>’s <NORP>anti-Russian</NORP> sanctions.It said goodbye to neutrality a long time ago.And we see no signs that <GPE>Switzerland</GPE> is ready to discuss ways out of the <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> conflict that would take into consideration <GPE>Russia</GPE>’s interests,\" the <GPE>Russia</GPE>n diplomats said.However, the <NORP>Swiss</NORP> <ORG>Foreign Ministry</ORG> emphasized that the <NORP>Central European</NORP> country not only favors involving <GPE>Moscow</GPE> in <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> talks but is also working toward that goal.\"Since the very beginning, <GPE>Switzerland</GPE> has stated that peace is possible with <GPE>Russia</GPE> only.We support maintaining dialogue with all sides as we continue working toward integrating <GPE>Russia</GPE> [in the process],\" <ORG>Foreign Ministry</ORG> Spokesman <PERSON>Jonas Montani</PERSON> said in an interview with <ORG>Izvestia</ORG>.\"<GPE>Switzerland</GPE> no longer has the moral right to be called a neutral state.While <GPE>Switzerland</GPE> could potentially regain its neutrality, it has not only become affiliated with the political <LOC>West</LOC> but is also one of its major mouthpieces,\" said <PERSON>Alexander Konkov</PERSON>, associate professor of <ORG>the Financial University</ORG> run by the <NORP>Russian</NORP> government.Even as <GPE>Switzerland</GPE> is not an <ORG>EU</ORG> member, <GPE>Bern</GPE> has supported all sanctions imposed on <GPE>Moscow</GPE> by <GPE>Brussels</GPE>, with <NORP>Swiss</NORP> restrictions currently affecting <CARDINAL>more than 2,200</CARDINAL> individuals, legal entities and businessmen.Also, the <NORP>Swiss</NORP> government has frozen <MONEY>$8.8 bln</MONEY> worth of <NORP><GPE>Russia</GPE>n</NORP> assets since <GPE>Russia</GPE> launched its special military operation.Meanwhile, <NORP>Ukrainian</NORP> President <PERSON>Vladimir Zelensky</PERSON> embarked on another <NORP>European</NORP> tour to promote his \"victory plan\" amid <GPE>Ukraine</GPE>’s failures on the battlefield, with the latest being the loss of <GPE>Ugledar</GPE>.He had big hopes for the <PERSON>Ramstein</PERSON> meeting originally scheduled to take place in <GPE>Germany</GPE> on <DATE>October 12</DATE>, but the organizers canceled the meeting without explaining why.On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <NORP>Russian</NORP> Foreign Minister <PERSON>Sergey Lavrov</PERSON> arrived in <GPE>Laos</GPE> to attend events hosted by <ORG>the Association of Southeast Asian Nations</ORG> (<ORG>ASEAN</ORG>).This is his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> visit to <GPE>Laos</GPE> <DATE>this year</DATE>.In <DATE>July</DATE>, he attended a meeting of foreign ministers, while this time around, he’s in <GPE>Vientiane</GPE> for higher-level summits.On <DATE>October 11</DATE>, <EVENT>the East Asia Summit</EVENT> will bring together <CARDINAL>18</CARDINAL> partners, including <GPE>Russia</GPE>, <GPE>the United States</GPE>, <ORG>the European Union</ORG>, <GPE>Japan</GPE>, <GPE>Australia</GPE>, <GPE>South Korea</GPE>, <GPE>India</GPE> and <GPE>China</GPE>, among other countries.<PERSON>Lavrov</PERSON> will take part in this event alongside <GPE>US</GPE> Secretary of <ORG>State</ORG> <PERSON>Antony Blinken</PERSON>.The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> top diplomats have not held bilateral meetings since the launch of the special military operation, nor are they planning to meet on <DATE>Friday</DATE>.<DATE>Today</DATE>’s summit will focus on security issues in <LOC>the</LOC> <LOC>Asia-Pacific</LOC> where, <GPE>Moscow</GPE> says, <LOC>the</LOC> situation has deteriorated amid <ORG>NATO</ORG>’s intentions to militarize <LOC>the</LOC> region.Earlier, <PERSON>Daniel Kritenbrink</PERSON>, <GPE>US</GPE> Assistant Secretary of <ORG>State</ORG> for <NORP>East Asian</NORP> and Pacific Affairs, announced that <GPE>Washington</GPE> plans to discuss human rights in <GPE>Myanmar</GPE>, what he called <GPE>China</GPE>’s reckless behavior in the South <GPE>China</GPE> Sea, where it has had sporadic clashes with <ORG>ASEAN</ORG> member countries over territorial claims, and <GPE>Ukraine</GPE>.Over <DATE>the past year</DATE>, since <GPE>Russia</GPE> has singled out <ORG>ASEAN</ORG> as a priority in its foreign policy doctrine, there has been no breakthrough in relations between <GPE>Russia</GPE> and the <NORP>Southeast Asian</NORP> union - and none was expected, Deputy Director of <ORG>HSE Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies</ORG> <PERSON>Alexander Korolev</PERSON> told <ORG>Vedomosti</ORG>.Rather, he said, <GPE>Russia</GPE> continues to develop relations with individual <ORG>ASEAN</ORG> member countries, primarily <GPE>Malaysia</GPE>, whose Prime Minister <PERSON>Anwar Ibrahim</PERSON> talked cooperation in <NORP>Islamic</NORP> banking at <EVENT>the Eastern Economic Forum</EVENT> in <GPE>Russia</GPE> and has been actively campaigning for his country's membership in <ORG>BRICS</ORG>, as have been <GPE>Vietnam</GPE>, <GPE>Myanmar</GPE> and <GPE>Indonesia</GPE>.According to <PERSON>Korolev</PERSON>, even as <ORG>ASEAN</ORG> has dodged any discussions on <GPE>Ukraine</GPE>, the topic still comes up at these twice yearly events.The talk, however, centers around the <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> conflict’s impact on food and energy security rather than its military and political implications.Therefore, <ORG>ASEAN</ORG> will formally refrain from taking sides with either <GPE>Russia</GPE> or the <LOC>West</LOC>, even as <ORG>ASEAN</ORG> diplomats often signal at informal meetings that they support <GPE>Russia</GPE>, the expert concluded.Developing cooperation between <GPE>Russia</GPE> and <GPE>China</GPE> in <LOC>Eurasia</LOC>, especially in <LOC>Central Asia</LOC>, will help the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> countries build a more just world order globally that reaps rewards for as many countries from <LOC>the Global South</LOC>, or what <GPE>Moscow</GPE> calls the global majority, as possible.At that, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> countries should focus on pragmatic aspects and mutual benefits rather than trying to oppose the <LOC>West</LOC> in their work, according to a joint report from <ORG>the Russian International Affairs Council</ORG>, <ORG>the Institute of China and Contemporary Asia</ORG> at <ORG>the Russian Academy of Sciences</ORG> and the <GPE>Shanghai-based</GPE> <ORG>Fudan University</ORG> seen by <ORG>Kommersant</ORG>.The <DATE>annual</DATE> report titled <WORK_OF_ART><GPE>Russia</GPE>n-Chinese Dialogue: The 2024 Model</WORK_OF_ART>, to be released <TIME>later on Friday</TIME> comes as <GPE>Russia</GPE> and <GPE>China</GPE> mark the <ORDINAL>75th</ORDINAL> anniversary of diplomatic relations.Among major conclusions, the report said that <GPE>Moscow</GPE> and <GPE>Beijing</GPE> should work together to develop relations with <LOC>Central Asia</LOC>, a key element of the Greater Eurasian Partnership Concept introduced by <GPE>Russia</GPE> and <GPE>China</GPE>’s <ORG>Belt and Road Initiative</ORG> and the nucleus of <ORG>the Shanghai Cooperation Organization</ORG> (<ORG>SCO</ORG>), to prevent the region from becoming another zone of competition.The joint role <GPE>Moscow</GPE> and <GPE>Beijing</GPE> are playing to develop the <ORG>SCO</ORG> and <ORG>BRICS</ORG> as brand-new international platforms is also key, the authors of the report insist.Both groups have expanded in political terms in <DATE>2024</DATE>, with <ORG>BRICS</ORG> doubling from <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> to <CARDINAL>10</CARDINAL> member countries and the <ORG>SCO</ORG>, too, increasing the number of its members to <CARDINAL>10</CARDINAL>.\"<GPE>Russia</GPE> and <GPE>China</GPE> are the driving forces behind <ORG>BRICS</ORG>  for the bulk of substantive initiatives originate from these <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> countries.In addition, <GPE>Russia</GPE> plays a leading role in aligning large players struggling to solve major disputes between themselves politically, such as <GPE>China</GPE> and <GPE>India</GPE> or <GPE>Iran</GPE> and <GPE>Saudi Arabia</GPE>.And <GPE>China</GPE> plays a similar role economically,\" <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the authors and director of the Institute of <GPE>China</GPE> and Contemporary Asia, <PERSON>Kirill Babayev</PERSON>, told <ORG>Kommersant</ORG>.On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <NORP>Russian</NORP> Presidential Aide <PERSON>Yury Ushakov</PERSON> who heads the organizing committee for the next <ORG>BRICS</ORG> summit told reporters that the grouping’s gathering in <GPE>Kazan</GPE> <DATE>later this month</DATE> could \"become the largest foreign policy event ever held in our country.\"So far, <CARDINAL>32</CARDINAL> countries have sent confirmations to attend the summit to which <CARDINAL>as many as 38</CARDINAL> countries, including <ORG>BRICS</ORG> member countries and nations seeking cooperation with the intergovernmental organization have been invited, <PERSON>Ushakov</PERSON> said.All <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <ORG>BRICS</ORG> member countries have agreed to take part, he added.Also, countries that chair regional integration associations in <LOC>Southeast Asia</LOC>, <LOC>Africa</LOC>, <LOC>Latin America</LOC> and <LOC>the Middle East</LOC> have been invited.The summit will also welcome <ORG>UN</ORG> Secretary-General <PERSON>Antonio Guterres</PERSON>, <ORG>SCO</ORG> Secretary General <PERSON>Zhang Ming</PERSON>, secretaries general from <GPE>the Commonwealth of Independent States</GPE>, the <ORG>EAEU</ORG>, <GPE>the Union State</GPE> as well as President of <ORG>the BRICS New Development Bank</ORG> <PERSON>Dilma Rousseff</PERSON>.The <ORDINAL>16th</ORDINAL> <ORG>BRICS</ORG> summit will be the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> held since the group’s <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> founding members <GPE>Russia</GPE>, <GPE>China</GPE>, <GPE>Brazil</GPE>, <GPE>India</GPE> and <GPE>South Africa</GPE> were joined by <GPE>Egypt</GPE>, <GPE>Ethiopia</GPE>, <GPE>Iran</GPE>, the <GPE>UAE</GPE> and <GPE>Saudi Arabia</GPE> <DATE>early this year</DATE>.As the original members of <ORG>BRICS</ORG> decided to expand at <DATE>last year’s</DATE> summit in <GPE>South Africa</GPE>, there are limited opportunities to accept more members, <PERSON>Yaroslav Lisovolik</PERSON>, founder of the <ORG>BRICS</ORG>+ Analytics company, said, as additional criteria and conditions for further expansion need to be formulated.However, there are <CARDINAL>tens</CARDINAL> of countries who would like to work with <ORG>BRICS</ORG>, the expert added.\"This is why the idea to establish a ‘belt of friends’ looks justified,\" <PERSON>Lisovolik</PERSON> told <ORG>Vedomosti</ORG>.The expert pointed to the growing interest in settlements in national currencies among <ORG>BRICS</ORG>.Additional payment systems could meet the rising demand for transactions between them.Merging the digital currency platforms of central banks from <ORG>BRICS</ORG> countries and their partners is the most interesting idea, he said.Multiple ideas and proposals have been announced ahead of the summit in <GPE>Kazan</GPE>, <PERSON>Denis Denisov</PERSON>, an expert at <ORG>the Financial University</ORG> run by the <NORP>Russian</NORP> government, said.These include setting up an alternative to <ORG>SWIFT</ORG> not only for the sake of financial diversification but also amid the West’s ability to impose sanctions on economies that it does not like within <TIME>hours</TIME>, the expert explained.<GPE>Russia</GPE> expects that foreign companies will largely cease to exit its market as it included a substantial decrease in revenues from gratuitous payments into its draft budget for <DATE>the next three years</DATE>, including those from the sale of assets of foreign owners, to a symbolic <MONEY>300 mln rubles</MONEY> ($<MONEY>3 mln</MONEY>) <DATE>annually</DATE> from <MONEY>141 bln rubles</MONEY> ($<MONEY>1.45 bln</MONEY>) that the authority expects to receive <DATE>this year</DATE>, <ORG>Izvestia</ORG> has learned.As the government has lowered expectations for gratuitous revenues in <DATE>2025-2027</DATE>, it obviously does not pencil in any major exit of foreigners, <PERSON>Natalya Milchakova</PERSON>, a lead analyst at <ORG>Freedom Finance Global</ORG>, argues.\"The majority of foreign owners who wanted to leave <GPE>Russia</GPE> have already done so - or will do so before <DATE>the end of 2024</DATE> - by paying a <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> fee.So, the government has perhaps achieved its goal - to let politically neutral foreign companies stay, especially when it comes to large market players,\" she said.Over <DATE>the past two years</DATE>, <ORG>McDonald's</ORG>, <ORG>Shell</ORG>, <ORG>Siemens</ORG>, <ORG>Nissan</ORG>, <ORG>IKEA</ORG> and other large global businesses have departed from <GPE>Russia</GPE>.In <DATE>2024</DATE> alone, <ORG>Danone</ORG>, <ORG>Hewlett-Packard</ORG> (<ORG>HP</ORG>), <ORG>Hyundai</ORG> and <GPE>Britain</GPE>’s <ORG>Unilever</ORG> have closed up shop in <GPE>Russia</GPE>, while <ORG>Philip Morris</ORG>, <ORG>Auchan</ORG> and <ORG>Metro</ORG> still stay.Gratuitous revenues are <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> major groups of budget revenues, with the other <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> being tax and non-tax revenues, <PERSON>Vladimir Klimanov</PERSON> from <ORG>the Presidential Academy</ORG> explained.However, these revenues are not critical for <GPE>Russia</GPE>’s coffers, he said.According to <PERSON>Milchakova</PERSON>, they accounted for a mere <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> of all budget revenues or <PERCENT>0.6%</PERCENT> of GDP <DATE>this year</DATE>, and <DATE>next year</DATE> they will amount to <PERCENT>less than 1%</PERCENT>, given the current draft budget.<ORG>TASS</ORG> is not responsible for the material quoted in these press

"<GPE>WASHINGTON</GPE>, <DATE>October 10</DATE>.<ORG>NATO</ORG> does not rule out the possibility of the <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> conflict going global, said <GPE>United States</GPE> <ORG>Space Force</ORG> Brigadier General <PERSON>Devin Pepper</PERSON>, who is deputy chief of staff for strategic plans and policy at <ORG>NATO</ORG> Supreme Allied Command Transformation.\"Here's <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> thing that I think is really a different way of viewing warfare in <ORG>NATO</ORG> than, as opposed to, let's say, the <GPE>US</GPE>.In <ORG>NATO</ORG>, we think of a <NORP>Eurasian</NORP> conflict,\" he said at an event hosted by <ORG>the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies</ORG>.According to <PERSON>Pepper</PERSON>, the bloc has to \"think about the global fight\" even with regard to the <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> conflict.\"That really comes down to that <NORP>Eurasian-centric</NORP> mindset that we have in <ORG>NATO</ORG>, it is not just, you know, focused on a fight with <GPE>Russia</GPE>, but it's focused on a fight that could go global,\" he stressed.<PERSON>Pepper</PERSON> also said that <GPE>Russia</GPE> still posed an existential threat to <ORG>NATO</ORG>, trying to influence its member states, allegedly through election meddling."
